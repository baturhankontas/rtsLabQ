Question 1

Question 2

Implementation in RTS2.java

Question 3

If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

I think one of the big problem on java is null pointer. I would change java to not let the running application shutdown when a null pointer occurs. Maybe objects could be initialized in a certain way to not to result a null pointer exception.

The other thing, NullPointerException isn't containing more information about what is null.
